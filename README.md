# Sextant

## A ReactiveUI navigation library for Xamarin.Forms

Sextant was born from a fork of [Xamvvm](https://github.com/xamvvm/xamvvm) which is nice and simple MVVM Framework with a good navigation system.
The problem is, I just wanted a simple navigation system to use with [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI) without all the things that come along an MVVM framework. Plus, I wanted to make it more "Reactive Friendly".

Then a wild [Rodney Littles]() appears, and with him an implementation of this [AMAZING POST](https://kent-boogaart.com/blog/custom-routing-in-reactiveui) by [Kent](https://github.com/kentcb)

Sextant is in a very initial stage and in constant change, so please be pantience with use... because we will break things.

This library is nothing more than me "standing on the shoulders of giants":
[Kent](https://github.com/kentcb) for been the original and true creator of this, I pretty much just copied and pasted it :)
[Geoffrey Huntley](https://github.com/ghuntley) maintainer on [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI) (especially the build.cake) from where learned a lot about Cake + AppVeyor
